I implemented the feature extraction code for the paper [1]. 
The fearures may not be perfect implementation. 
The features are used for our papers [2,3]. 
If you use the code please cite the papers. 

===============
1) To run this code:
+ Include vl_feat library : http://www.vlfeat.org/download.html. 
   Firstly, download and unpack the latest VLFeat binary distribution into a directory of your choice (e.g. ~/src/vlfeat). Let VLFEATROOT denote this directory.
   Then edit startup.m in userpath(this is a matlab command) with:
       run('VLFEATROOT/toolbox/vl_setup');
       fprintf(strcat('Installed VLFeat(version:',vl_version,').\n'));
   Now when you restart MATLAB everytime, you should see the VLFeat installed automatically.
+ mex HoG.cpp according to your machine (I include linux and windows version).
